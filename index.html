            <p>My name is Carlin. I'm currently a student in New York City. I do programming, electrical prototyping, theater tech, and video editing.
              <br>I write in <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, CSS, and HTML. I also volunteer as Assistant Head of Information Technology at <a href="http://tmrci.org/home-page.html">The Model railroad Club Incorporated</a>.
              <br>I volunteer as a board operator on an ETC element, do lighting design for many of my school's smaller productions, and was recently booth manager for a school production of 12<sup>th</sup> Night.
              <br>I've been video editor for the video of many of my school's plays.</p>
