            <h2>How It All Began</h2>
            <p>My father did some side work as a database programmer in Microsoft Access, so I've had code in the air since I was born. Up until I was 5 or 6, the only computer I had access to was a Compaq running Windows 98, every once in a while my father
              would let me write things on the boot screen (that was back when computers had boot screens you could type on). Never anything of note, I just liked writing in this weird space that you had to have good timing to get to. Around when I was
              5 I was impressed by my mother's Office computer, one that ran Windows XP. Shortly after that we got a Gateway running Windows Vista. On that Gateway I started playing Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and was quickly modding it. In 5<sup>th</sup>              grade I got a copy of John Deere Drive Green, and almost Immediately learned how to mess with the XML files that the game used to track the players. Before and after 5<sup>th</sup> grade I spent some time in programming camps, but they just
              weren’t my &quot;thing&quot; It was at one of those camps that I got to be in a class of high school students because all the middle school classes were too easy. In those camps I leaned basic game design and some very basic java. In the
              summer before 9<sup>th</sup> grade I received a Sparkfun Inventor's Kit, and used it to teach myself <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and <a href=”https://carlingr.github.io/electric”> basic electronics </a>. In the summer before
              10
              <sup>th</sup> grade I spent about 5 weeks interning at my school's tech department, and due to a staffing shortage ended up as part of the backup IT team. In 10<sup>th</sup> grade I learned <a href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a Java script
              Implementation. In the process of that, and with the help of <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a> I taught myself HTML and CSS. Around then I started building websites. I currently volunteer as Assistant Head of Information
              Technology at <a href="http://tmrci.org/home-page.html">The Model Railroad Club Incorporated</a>, where my duties include helping members with day to day problems, interspersed with adjusting the life support on the computer that runs part
              of our railroad, running MS DOS. My favorite Operating system, by the way, is MS DOS. I currently work on a Lenovo Laptop running Win 8, and have a backup computer that is a 2009 MacBook, which I purchased for school and use from time to
              time.
