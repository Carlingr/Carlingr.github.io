    <p>I got into theater because the club I was in dissolved, so I went to my second choice club, Theater AV. I was always at the club, but due to fear of missing classes I never did any shows until the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade. Around then I learned
      that I really enjoyed theater, and started finding time to work on classes and theater. In high school I ended up as one of the most knowledgeable people in the theater, often being called to be Stage Manager or Assistant Technical Director of plays.
      I spent much of my free time hanging around theaters during rehearsal, soaking up all I could. The theater I'm in now uses an ETC element, and I am the senior board operator.</p>
